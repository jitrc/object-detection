# Object-detection
Dockerized workspace for 2D/3D object detection, segmentation, tracking, anything related to perception.

Framework: Both Tensorflow and Pytorch supported.

Libs: Fastai, tensorflow models, second.pytorch and detectron2 also included

Data: Most experiments would be done on public datasets like Kitti, and sometimes smaller data like Pets for quick iteration.

Environment variables for easy access to different paths:
* TF_OBJECT_DETECTION_API
* SECOND_API

## Docker

### Setup
Recommended symlink your data dir to `./data`
```
ln -s <path_to_your_data_root> data
```

### Build
```
make docker-build
```
### Run

Default entry
```
make docker-run-default
```

Bash into an existing container
```
make docker-exec-bash
```

Run with bash only
```
make docker-run-bash
```

Jupyter Lab in docker
```
make docker-run-jupyter
```
### Makefile variables
You can ooveride the deafutl values of different componets of the 
docker build or run options using makefile variables from command line.
See makefile for details, here are some examples:
* DATA: path to data
* TF_PACKAGE_VERSION: Tensorflow version
* TORCH_VERSION: Pytorch version

Usage: 
```
make docker-build TF_PACKAGE_VERSION=2.0.0
```
