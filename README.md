# Dockerized workspace for 2D/3D object detection.
Anything related to Robotics and Autonomous Vehicle Perception using Deep Learning.  
May include classification, detection, segmentation, tracking, pose estimation.

**Framework**: Both Tensorflow and Pytorch supported.  

**Libs**: Fastai, tensorflow models, second.pytorch and detectron2 also included  

**Data**: Most experiments would be done on public datasets like Kitti, and sometimes smaller data like Pets for quick iteration.  

**Environment variables** for easy access to different paths:
* TF_OBJECT_DETECTION_API
* SECOND_API

**Included Notebooks/Scripts**
* [Tensorflow Object Detection](workspace/tensorflow)
   * [Pets](workspace/tensorflow/Pets)
   * [Kitti](workspace/tensorflow/kitti)
* [Pytorch](workspace/pytorch)
   * [Senond/Pointpillars](workspace/pytorch/SenondPointpillars.bash_scripts.ipynb)
* [Fast.ai examples from course](workspace/fastai)

## Docker

### Setup
Recommended symlink your data dir to `./data`
```
ln -s <path_to_your_data_root> data
```

### Build
```
make docker-build
```
### Run

Default entry
```
make docker-run-default
```

Bash into an existing container
```
make docker-exec-bash
```

Run with bash only
```
make docker-run-bash
```

Jupyter Lab in docker
```
make docker-run-jupyter
```
### Makefile variables
You can override the default values of different components of the 
docker build or run options using makefile variables from the command line.
See `config.mk` for details, here are some examples:
* DATA: path to data
* TF_PACKAGE_VERSION: Tensorflow version
* TORCH_VERSION: Pytorch version

Usage: 
```
make docker-build TF_PACKAGE_VERSION=2.0.0
```
